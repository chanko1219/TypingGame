child's laboratory? What essentials must we 
provide if we would deliberately plan 
an environment to promote the developmental 
possibilities of play? These questions are raised 
with ever-increasing insistence as the true 
nature of children's play and its 
educational significance come to be matters 
of more general knowledge and the 
selection of play equipment assumes a 
corresponding importance in the school and 
at home. To indicate some fundamental rules 
for the choice of furnishings and 
toys and to show a variety 
of materials illustrating the basis of 
selection has been our aim in 
compiling the following brief catalogue. We 
do not assume the list to 
be complete, nor has it been 
the intention to recommend any make 
or pattern as being indispensable or 
as having an exclusive right to 
the field. On the contrary, it 
is our chief hope that the 
available number and variety of such 
materials may be increased to meet 
a corresponding increase of intelligent demand 
on the part of parents and 
teachers for equipment having real dignity 
and play value. The materials listed were 
originally assembled in the Exhibit of 
Toys and School Equipment shown by 
the Bureau of Educational Experiments in 
the Spring and Summer of 1917, 
and we wish to make acknowledgment, 
therefore, to the many who contributed 
to that exhibit and by so 
doing to the substance of the 
following pages. Chief among them are 
Teachers College, The University of Pittsburgh, 
The Ethical Culture School, The Play 
School and other experimental schools described 
in our bulletins, numbers 3, 4 
and 5The cuts have been chosen 
for the most part from photographs 
of the Play School, where conditions 
fairly approximate those obtainable in the 
home and thus offer suggestions easily 
translatable by parents into terms of 
their own home environment. While this equipment 
is especially applicable to the needs 
of children four, five and six 
years old, most of it will 
be found well adapted to the 
interests of children as old as 
eight years, and some of it 
to those of younger children as 
well.
