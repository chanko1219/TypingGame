To indicate some fundamental rules for the
choice of furnishings and toys and to
show a variety of materials illustrating the
basis of selection has been our aim
in compiling the following brief catalogue. We
do not assume the list to be
complete, nor has it been the recommend
any make or pattern as being indispensable
or chief hope that the available number
and variety of such materials may be
increased to meet a corresponding increase of
intelligent demand on the part of parents
and teachers for equipment having real dignity
and play value.
